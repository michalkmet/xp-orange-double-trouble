# Notes

Given an array of integers (x), and a target (t), you must find out if any two consecutive numbers in the array sum to t. If so, remove the second number.

Example:

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
t = 3

1+2 = t, so remove 2. No other pairs = t, so rest of array remains:

[1, 3, 4, 5]

Work through the array from left to right.

Return the resulting array.

User Story 1: two numbers -> return 1 number
As a user, I want to pass in two numbers, so that I can see jaden case function working

- âœ… DONE UAT1.1: Given I'm going to use the doubleTrouble function, When I pass '[0, 1], 1', Then it should return [0]
- âœ… DONE UAT1.2: Given I'm going to use the doubleTrouble function, When I pass '[1, 2], 3', Then it should return [1]
- âœ… DONE UAT1.3: Given I'm going to use the doubleTrouble function, When I pass '[2, 3], 5', Then it should return [2]
 
User Story 2: three numbers -> return 2 numbers
As a user, I want to pass in three numbers, so that I can see doubleTrouble function working

- âš  TODO UAT1.1: Given I'm going to use the doubleTrouble function, When I pass '[2, 3, 1], 4', Then it should return [2, 3]
